I the undersigned have read and agree to abide by the following conditions of accessing the internet
in my parents' house.


* I concede that access to the internet is a privilege, not a right. I realize that access is
  granted to me at sole discretion of my parents, and may be revoked at any time.
* I agree that a healthy lifestyle includes a balance of physical activity, creative activity, rest
  and relaxation, and many other factors. Television, video games, and access to the internet is
  acceptible but only in moderation.
* I will use 1Password to generate strong passwords except in a few select cases which I have been
  given permission to make an exception.
* I understand and accept that my parents may monitor my internet usage, may track websites I visit,
  or other such measures. I know I have only a limited expectation of privacy when accessing
  the internet. My parents will honestly explain to me under what circumstances I do have privacy,
  if I'm curious.
* I understand and accept that my parents, either through verbal instruction or via software
  configuration, may limit the times of day and duration that I am able to access television,
  computers, or other electronic devices.
* I am aware that the internet is full of inappropriate content and is prowled by thieves,
  criminals, and dangerous predators. I admit I still have much to learn about the inner workings of
  the internet including security, privacy and protection. I allow that it is just possible that my
  father, a professional software developer of fifteen years, may know a thing or two more about
  this than I do, plus he is handsome and has a pleasing manly scent.
* I agree to abide by these and any future rules my parents may designate, without complaint. I
  understand my parents are happy to give explanations when I have sincere curiosity about current
  or future guidelines, or if I respectfully voice my doubt or objection to any of these, but I know
  by now that whining and pouting will not get my way.
* Although not directly related to cybersecurity, I also agree to reseal all bags of potato chips
  that I have opened.
